# 🚀 Customer Churn Prediction using ANN & Streamlit

## 📌 Project Overview

Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges for banks and subscription-based businesses.
This project builds an **end-to-end Machine Learning solution** that predicts whether a customer is likely to leave the bank using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** and deploys it through an **interactive Streamlit web application**.

The goal is simple:

> **Help businesses identify risky customers early and take actions to retain them.**

---

## 🎯 Motivation

Losing existing customers is far more expensive than acquiring new ones.
By analyzing customer attributes such as **credit score, age, balance, activity status, and geography**, this model can:

* Detect potential churn in advance
* Support better **customer retention strategies**
* Enable **data-driven business decisions**

This project demonstrates how **Machine Learning moves from notebook → real application**.

## 🧠 Tech Stack

* **Python** for data processing and modeling
* **Scikit-learn** for preprocessing & scaling
* **TensorFlow / Keras** for building the ANN model
* **Streamlit** for interactive web deployment
* **Pickle** for saving encoders and scaler

---

## ⚙️ Key Features

* End-to-end ML pipeline (data → training → deployment)
* ANN-based binary classification model
* Proper preprocessing using **Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding, and Standard Scaling**
* Real-time prediction through a **user-friendly Streamlit UI**
* Clean and production-ready project structure

---

## 📊 Model Workflow

1. Data preprocessing & feature engineering
2. Train-test split and feature scaling
3. ANN model training with **early stopping**
4. Saving model and preprocessing objects
5. Streamlit app for **live customer churn prediction**
